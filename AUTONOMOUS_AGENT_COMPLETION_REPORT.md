## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Research Flow

```
User Query + Files → File Analysis → Research Strategy →
Web Search Queries → Source Collection → Sufficiency Check →
Report Generation → Citation Integration → Final Output
```

### Autonomous Decision Tree

```
Files Uploaded? → File-First Analysis → Web Research for Gaps
No Files? → Pure Web Research → Multi-Query Strategy
```

### Real-Time Streaming

```
Status Updates → Source Discovery → Learning Extraction →
Reflection → Replanning (if needed) → Final Report
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Prerequisites for Testing

1. **Gemini API Key**: Add `VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` to environment variables
2. **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:8082
3. **File Uploads**: PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT files supported

### Test Scenarios

1. **Normal Research**: Short query, expect 400 words, 20-30 sources
2. **Deep Research**: Complex query, expect 800 words, 120+ sources
3. **File-First**: Upload document, watch file analysis priority
4. **Pure Web**: No files, observe multi-query strategy
5. **Progress Tracking**: Watch real-time source count updates
